                    <h1>How to build minimum lovable products</h1>
                    <p>
                        Building great products is hard. Most new products fail. But what if there was a way to improve your chances of success? In his book "The Lean Product Playbook," entrepreneur and Lean product expert Dan Olsen lays out a repeatable, easy-to-follow methodology for iterating your way to product-market fit. I recently read the book and shared my notes and understanding in a webinar, and I'm excited to share the key takeaways with you in this blog post.
